Algorithm Challenge #8 – Digit Frequency Counter
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program reads a positive main number and a single digit, then determines how many times that digit appears in the number.

This challenge strengthens digit extraction, comparison logic, and loop-based processing.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
How to extract digits using modulo and integer division

How to compare digits and count matches

Looping through numbers efficiently

Ensuring safe and validated user input

Enhancing arithmetic-based algorithmic thinking

🧩 Example
-
Input:

Main Number: 1223222

Digit to Check: 2

Output:

Digit 2 Frequency is 5 Time(s)

📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: digit_frequency.cpp

Challenge Number: #8

💬 Notes
-
Digit frequency is a fundamental concept used in data processing, number analysis, and competitive programming.
This version uses pure arithmetic without converting the number into a string, making it efficient and suitable for technical interviews.
